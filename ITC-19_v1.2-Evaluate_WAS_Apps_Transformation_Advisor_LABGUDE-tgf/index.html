<p><strong>Modernizing WebSphere / Java applications for Cloud and Containers</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="lab-evaluate-on-premises-java-applications-with-ibm-cloud-transformation-advisor">Lab:  Evaluate On-Premises Java Applications with IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor</h2>
<p>On the journey to cloud, enterprise customers are facing challenges
moving their existing on-premises applications to cloud quickly and
cost-effectively. The I<strong>BM</strong> <strong>Cloud Pak for Applications</strong> provides a complete and consistent experience and solution to modernize enterprise applications for cloud-native deployments. Customers can easily modernize their existing applications with IBM’s integrated tools and develop new cloud-native applications faster for deployment on any cloud. One of the tools included in the Pak is the IBM Cloud
Transformation Advisor (<strong>Transformation Advisor</strong>), a developer tool
that is available at no charge to help you quickly evaluate on-premises Java EE applications for deployment to the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>The Transformation Advisor tool can</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>identify the Java EE programming models in the app.</li>
<li>determine the complexity of apps by listing a high-level inventory
    of the content and structure of each app.</li>
<li>highlight Java EE programming model and WebSphere API differences
    between the WebSphere profile types</li>
<li>learn any Java EE specification implementation differences that
    might affect the app</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the tool provides a recommendation for the right-fit IBM
WebSphere Application Server edition and offers advice, best practices
and potential solutions to assess the ease of moving apps to Liberty or newer versions of WebSphere traditional. It will accelerate application migrating to cloud process, minimize errors and risks and reduce time to market.</p>
<p>This lab is a part of the Application Modernization lab series which
focus on the evaluation, re-platform, repackage, and refactor
modernization approaches and solutions.</p>
<p>This lab covers the evaluation process. It will show the value of using <strong>Transformation Advisor</strong> to evaluate on-premises Java applications and identify a migration candidate for moving to the cloud. When you complete this lab, you will learn how to use this tool to quickly analyze on-premise Java applications without accessing their source code and to estimate the move to cloud efforts.</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="business-scenario">Business Scenario</h2>

<h2 id="lab-tasks">Lab Tasks</h2>
<p>In this lab, you access WebSphere Application Server to review the
deployment of the JEE applications. Then you are going to the
Transformation Advisor to identify a good candidate application for
moving to cloud.</p>
<p>To identify which Java EE programming models are on the server, you
could run the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool against the
server. The Transformation Advisor creates an inventory of the content
and structure of each app and learn about problems that might occur if
you move the app to cloud.</p>
<p>Finally, you review the analysis reports to determine the complexity of the move-to-cloud efforts and select the migration candidate app.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the activities involved in this process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Log in to WebSphere Application Server to review the deployed JEE
    applications</li>
<li>Run the Transformation Advisor Data Collector tool against the
    WebSphere Application Server to get application data</li>
<li>Review the analysis reports that Transformation Advisor generates to identify the right candidate application for a rapid and
    cost-effective migration to cloud</li>

<p>The zipped Data Collector utility file will be saved in /<strong>home/ibmdemo/Downloads</strong> directory of <strong>Workstation</strong> VM.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br> </p>
<h2 id="run-transformation-advisor-data-collector-utility"><strong>Run Transformation Advisor Data Collector utility</strong></h2>
<p>After downloading the zipped Data Collector utility, we need to unpack
it and run the utility against the WAS server to collect all the data of deployed applications and their configuration from the WAS server.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go back to the terminal window and navigate the <strong>/home/ibmdemo/Downloads</strong> directory and view its contents with commands:</p>
<pre><code>cd /home/ibmdemo/Downloads/

ls -l
</code></pre>
<p>You can see the downloaded data collector utility file saved in the directory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image23.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extract the data collector utility with commands:</p>
<pre><code>tar xvfz transformationadvisor-Linux\_Evaluation\_Server1.tgz
</code></pre>
<p>The data collector utility will be extracted to
<strong><em>/home/ibmdemo/Downloads</em>/transformationadvisor-2.0.2</strong> directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Execute the <strong>Data Collector</strong> utility with the commands below to
    start collect the deployed applications information on the WAS
    server.</p>
<pre><code>cd /home/ibmdemo/Downloads*/transformationadvisor-2.0.2

sudo ./bin/transformationadvisor -w /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer -p AppSrv01 wsadmin passw0rd

<li>
<p>Type <strong>1</strong> to accept the license agreement and press <strong>Enter</strong>, as
    illustrated below</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" src="../itc19/media/image24.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The utility will start to collect application data.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" src="../itc19/media/image25.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This process will take a few minutes to complete, depending on how many applications are deployed on the WAS server. In this lab, it might be a few minutes.</p>
<p>When the collection utility competes, you will see a message “<strong>Thank  you for uploading your data. You can proceed to the application UI for doing further analysis.”</strong></p>
<p>Your application data is collected, it is saved as a zip file in
 directory <strong>/home/ibmdemo/Downloads/transformationadvisor-2.0.2/AppSrv01.zip</strong>, as shown below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="A close up of text on a screen Description automatically generated" src="../itc19/media/image26.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In general, if your application server and the <strong>Transformation  Advisor</strong> are in the same network infrastructure, the collected data will be automatically uploaded to <strong>Transformation Advisor</strong> for you to view the analysis results.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you must manually upload the data to <strong>Transformation Advisor</strong> before you can view the results.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<h2 id="evaluate-on-premises-java-applications"><strong>Evaluate On-Premises Java Applications</strong></h2>
<p>In this section, we are going to use <strong>Transformation Advisor</strong> UI to
view the application data analysis results.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go back to <strong>Transformation Advisor</strong> page in web browser, click the <strong>Recommendations</strong> link to the <strong>Recommendations</strong> page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically  generated" src="../itc19/media/image27.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <strong>Recommendations</strong> page, you can see all applications deployed to the WAS server are listed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically
generated" src="../itc19/media/image28.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the <strong>Recommendations</strong> page, the identified <strong>migration source
 environment</strong> is shown in the <strong>Profile</strong> section, and the <strong>target
 environment</strong> is shown in the <strong>Preferred migration</strong> section. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image29.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The data collector tool detects that the source environment is your WebSphere Application Server ND <strong>AppSrv01</strong> profile. The target environment is <strong>Liberty on Private Cloud</strong>, which is the default target environment.</p>
<p>The Recommendations page also shows the <strong>summary analysis results</strong> for all the apps in the <strong>AppSrv01</strong> environment to be moved to a Liberty on Private Cloud environment.</p>
<p><strong>For each app, you can see these results:</strong>
- Complexity level
- Technology match
- Dependencies
- Issues
- Estimated development cost in days</p>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image30.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if you want to move the
 <strong>modresorts-1_0_war.ear</strong> application to Liberty on Private Cloud,
 the complexity level is <strong>Simple</strong>.</p>
<p>The Tech match is <strong>100%</strong>, which indicates that the application code <strong>does not need to be changed</strong> before it can be moved to cloud. The application has no dependency, has <strong>1 minor level issue</strong> and the estimated development effort is 0 day.</p>
<p>As you can see, the default move to cloud environment is <strong>Liberty on Private Cloud</strong>. However <strong>Transformation Advisor</strong> can also provide migration options if you want to migrate your application to different target environments. In this lab we are focusing on identifying a good candidate for moving to the Liberty on Private Cloud environment, so the default target environment will work for us. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="./itc19/media/image31.png" width="450" height="300"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you look at the complexities of these applications, you can see
 that the <strong>moderesorts-1.0_war.ear</strong> (<strong>Mod Resorts</strong> app) and
 <strong>pbw-ear.ear</strong> (<strong>PlansByWebSphere</strong> app) has the simple complexity,
 which mean that these two apps can be migrated to cloud without any
 code change.</p>
<p>But since the <strong>moderesorts-1.0_war.ear</strong> app has fewer potential issues (1) than the <strong>pbw-ear.ear</strong> app (4).</p>
<p>Let’s look at the analysis results for <strong>moderesorts-1.0_war.ear</strong> application in detail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <strong>modresorts-1_0_war.ear</strong> link to expand its analysis
    results to view the assessment and reports.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image32.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first section in the detail analysis summary page is the <strong>Overall
Complexity</strong> section. The overall complexity for the application is
<strong>simple</strong>, indicating that the application can be directly moved to
cloud without any code change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image33.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p>a) Scroll down to <strong>Application Details</strong> section.</p>
<p>You can see there is <strong>no code change</strong> required.</p>
<p>The the estimate migration overhead development cost is 5 days.</p>
<p>This estimate is based on data from IBM Services engagements,which includes migrating management, server configuration, and testing.</p>

whether these technologies are supported by a specific WebSphere
platform from Liberty for Java on IBM Cloud to WebSphere traditional
for z/OS.</p>
<p>It is used to determine whether a particular WebSphere product is
suitable for an application.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image37.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we can see from the report, the <strong>Mod Resorts</strong> application only uses Java Servlet which is supported by all WebSphere platforms.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the analysis reports we looked at above, we know that the <strong>Mod Resorts</strong> application is supported by Liberty on Private Cloud as the target environment, and the issue that the tool identified would not affect the application migration.</p>
<p>You can confidently select the application as a good candidate for moving to liberty on cloud in the repackage process with minimum effort.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now you know that the <strong>Mod Resorts</strong> application can be repacked to Liberty on cloud, you want to know if it is also a good candidate to re-platform with WAS Base on cloud.</p>
<p>a) To do that, return to the TA <strong>recommendations</strong> page. Then
    change the target environment from <strong>Liberty on Private
    Cloud</strong> to <strong>WebSphere Traditional on Private Cloud</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="./itc19/media/image48.png" width="450" height="400"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As you can see from the TA recommendation, the <strong>Mod Resorts</strong> application is also a good candidate for re-platform in WAS container on cloud, if desired.</p>
<p>If you want to review the recommendation details, you can follow the same steps you did before to go over them.</p>

<h3 id="how-transformation-advisor-helps-modernize-a-java-ee-application-to-ibm-cloud-pak-for-applications-on-redhat-openshift">How Transformation Advisor helps Modernize a Java EE application to IBM Cloud Pak for Applications on RedHat OpenShift**</h3>
<p>Transformation Advisor helps accelerate the development activities
required during the modernization of a Java EE application currently
deployed to IBM WebSphere Application Server, Oracle WebLogic, Apache
Tomcat or Red Hat JBoss Application Server.</p>
<p><img alt="A close up of a map Description automatically
generated" src="../itc19/media/image50.png" /></p>
<p>The capabilities of Transformation Advisor help bring the cloud-native
development experience to the modernization of existing WebSphere / Java applications.</p>
<p>For reference, the cloud-native development process using Application
Stacks simplifies the process of building and deploying applications to Kubernetes</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image51.png" /></p>
<p>View the <strong>migration bundle</strong> contents for the ModResorts application</p>
<p>Transformation Advisor generates migration artifacts that are needed to deploy a modernized application to IBM Cloud Pak for Applications and RedHat OpenShift. This section simply provides a quick peak into this exciting capability from Transformation Advisor. Additional hands-on labs on these capabilities can be arranged through your IBM
representative.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click on the menu with the “hamburger icon” next to the ModResorts
    application analysis to display the menu choices and choose <strong>View
    migration plan</strong>:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image52.png" />  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transformation Advisor will display details about the migration
bundle that it generated to accelerate the modernization of this
application into IBM Cloud Pak for Applications. The migration
bundle includes diverse artifacts, depending on the needs of the
application.  </p>
<p>As illustrated below, the user can choose to create a migration
bundle for either:
- a <strong>binary</strong> project of an application (uploading a WAR/EAR file and its dependent libraries)
- a <strong>source</strong> project of an application, so that the application
source files can be modernized and maintained.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image53.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notice the contents of the migration bundle. (<strong>Migration Files</strong>)  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image54.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The artifacts change, depending on the user’s modernization choices for the application (Source or Binary).</p>
<p>The default selection for an application that uses only EE7 features
and above will be to deploy as a <strong>source application project</strong>.</p>
<p>The project will be a source project, with the directory structure set
up with a starter application and the Liberty configuration for the
application.  </p>
<p>To accelerate the application modernization, the artifacts produced by
Transformation Advisor include the configuration for the Liberty
server, the build file for the application which can used with the
Application Stacks, Dockerfile and Operator files for containerized
deployments to RedHat OpenShift with IBM Cloud Pak for Applications.  </p>
<p>The user will be able to choose to <strong>download</strong> the artifacts as a
migration bundle or <strong>push the bundle contents into a GitHub</strong>
repository. See the illustration below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image55.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A complete exploration of these exciting capabilities is beyond the scope of this lab. However, these powerful features avaiable in Transformation Advisor help expedite the journey to cloud for existing WebSphere Applications. </p>
<p><br> </p>
<h2 id="evaluate-the-plantsbywebsphere-application"><strong>Evaluate the PlantsByWebSphere Application</strong></h2>
<p>You have evaluated and assessed modernizing a simple application that uses only a single Java EE technology.  Now, let’s explore a more sophisticated Java EE application that was developed using many Java EE API's found in traditional WebSphere Applications. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Navigate back to the <strong>Transformation Advisor</strong> <strong>Recommendations</strong>
    page. You can follow the same procedure you did for the <strong>Mod
    Resorts</strong> application to view the analysis results for the
    <strong>PlantsByWebSphere</strong> application.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image56.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see from the Summary list, the recommendations for the  application to move to cloud are as follows: 
  - The complexity level is Simple.
  - Tech match is 100%, which means that the application code can be
deployed to Liberty on Private Cloud without any changes. 
  - The app has 3 dependencies and 7 issues, including 1 high severity
level, 1 medium severity level and 5 low severity level. 
  - The estimated development effort is 0 day because no code changes
are needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View the <strong>Application Technology report</strong> for
    <strong>PlantsByWebSphereEE6.ear</strong> application.</p>
<p>Notice all of the technologies that this application uses, all of which are suported in ALL of the editions of WebSPhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image57.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image58.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="evaluate-the-complex-defaultappliction-application"><strong>Evaluate the Complex DefaultAppliction Application</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Navigate back to the <strong>Transformation Advisor</strong> <strong>Recommendations</strong> page. Select the <strong>DefaultApplication.ear</strong> application.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc19/media/image59.png" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see from the Summary list, this is a more complex application to modernize.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>View the <strong>Application Technology report</strong> for
    <strong>DefaultApplication.ear</strong> application.</p>
<p>As you review the Technology report, you will discover that the application makes extensive use of EJB Entity Beans. EJB Entity beans are a deprecated Java EE technology, and not supported in WebSphere Liberty, which is the preferred WebSphere edition for Cloud environments.  </p>
<p>The modernization of this application is more complex due to the need to rewrite parts of the application with Java EE technologies that are supported on WebSphere Liberty.</p>
<p>However, <strong>WAS Base</strong> in <strong>containers</strong> is an alternative for running the application in IBM Cloud Pak for Applications with RedHat OpenShift. This option would allow you to move the application to cloud in containers (IBM Cloud Pak for Applications with Redhat OpenShift) with little or NO code changes.</p>
<p>As the technology report reveals, the EJB Entity Beans technologies are supported in the traditional WAS Base and WAS ND editions. WAS Base in containers is a supported configuration in IB Cloud Pak for Applications.</p>
<p>So, for this application, you might choose to move the application to WAS Base in containers, on cloud.</p>
