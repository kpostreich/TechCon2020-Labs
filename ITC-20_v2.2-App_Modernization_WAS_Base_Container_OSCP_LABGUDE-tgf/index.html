<p><br> </p>
<h2 id="lab-app-modernization-using-was-base-container-on-ocp">Lab: App Modernization Using WAS Base Container on OCP</h2>
<p>On the journey to cloud, enterprise customers are facing challenges moving their existing on-premises applications to cloud quickly and cost-effectively.</p>
<p>The <strong>IBM Cloud Pak for Applications</strong> provides a complete and
consistent experience and solution to modernize enterprise applications for cloud-native deployments. Customers can easily modernize their existing applications with IBM’s integrated tools and develop new cloud-native applications faster for deployment on any cloud.</p>
<p>One of the tools included in the Cloud Pak for Applications is the <strong>IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor,</strong> a tool that is available at no charge to help you quickly evaluate on-premises Java EE applications and to prepare the apps for a rapid cloud deployment.</p>
<p>IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor provides recommendations for the
right-fit IBM WebSphere Application Server edition, and offers advice, best practices, and potential solutions to assess the ease of moving apps to Liberty or newer versions of WebSphere traditional on-premises or to the cloud. It accelerates application modernization to cloud while minimizing risk and reducing time to market.</p>
<p>This lab exercise is a part of the Application Modernization lab series which focus on re-platforming WebSphere on-premise application as part of the modernization to cloud journey.</p>
<p>We will demonstrate how to move a selected Java application from
traditional WebSphere Application Server (WAS) environment to a <strong>WAS container</strong> without any code change and to deploy it to <strong>Red Hat OpenShift</strong> (OpenShift) cluster environment in <strong>IBM Cloud Pak for Applications</strong>.</p>
<p>For more information on how to install a local version of the
<strong>Transformation Advisor</strong>, please visit:

<h2 id="business-scenario">Business Scenario</h2>
<p>As illustrated below, your company has a web app called <strong>Mod Resorts</strong>, a WebSphere application showing the weather in various locations. Your company wants to move this application from on-premises (in VMs) to the cloud (in Containers) using <strong>IBM Cloud Pak for Applications</strong>.</p>
<p>This transition delivers improved operational efficiencies for the
application by leveraging scalable cloud capabilities with IBM Cloud Pak for Applications that the enterprise currently enjoys with its cloud native applications.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc20/media/image3.png" /></p>
<p>As a tech lead, you have already analyzed the application using <strong>IBM Cloud</strong> <strong>Transformation Advisor.</strong></p>
<p>Based on the analysis, you know that you can move this application from the traditional WebSphere Server ND cell environment to a containerized WAS Base server environment without any code change. </p>
<p>Now you are planning to package the application in WAS Base traditional container and to deploy it to an OpenShift Kubernetes cluster environment in <strong>IBM Cloud Pak for Applications</strong>.</p>
<p>By moving an application from a traditional WAS ND cell to a WAS Base container in cloud, you can take advantage of cloud to support application high availability and scalability, minimize application migration effort, reduce on-prem infrastructure and operation cost while leveraging your team’s existing WebSphere admin skills.</p>
<p><br> </p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>There are five key files you needed to build your WAS Base server
container image:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dockerfile</strong>: The file defines how the Docker image that has your application and configuration pre-loaded is built</li>
<li><strong>App runtime:</strong> The ear or war file of your application</li>
<li><strong>app-install.props</strong>: The file defines how to install your
    application in the WAS server</li>
<li><strong>appConfig.py:</strong> The WAS admin script in Jython format configures the WAS server for your application</li>
<li>
<p><strong>PASSWORD:</strong> The file contains the WAS server console password use in the WAS container</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review Dockerfile, app-install.props file, and appConfig.py files</p>
<p>a)  From the Desktop tool bar, click the <strong>File Manager</strong> icon to open it.</p>
<p><img src="./itc20/media/image19.png" width="400" height="250"></p>
<p>b) Navigate to <strong>/home/ibmdemo/cp4a-labs/lab2b</strong> directory.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" src="../itc20/media/image20.png" /></p>
<p>c) Double click the <strong>Dockerfile</strong> to open it in <strong>Text editor</strong> for reviewing.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically &gt; generated" src="../itc20/media/image21.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the <strong>Dockerfile</strong> file defines the following activities to create a WAS Base container image:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the base WAS image from Docker Hub</li>
<li>Add WAS admin console password to the WAS Base image</li>
<li>Add the WAS server configuration script to the WAS base image</li>
<li>Add the application installation script to the WAS base image</li>
<li>Add the application runtime file to the WAS base image</li>
<li>Run the configuration script to config the WAS server instance inside the container to configure the WAS server and to install the application</li>
</ul>
<p>d) Go back to File Manager and double click <strong>app-install.props</strong> file to review it. This is the file that defines the properties for installing the <strong>Modresorts</strong> application to the WAS server instance.</p>
<p><img src="./itc20/media/image22.png" width="500" height="400"></p>
<p>e) In the File Manager window, double click <strong>appConfig.py</strong> file to review its contents.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a standard WAS admin script with Jython format for configuring WAS to run the <strong>Mod Resorts</strong> application.</p>
<p>This is the WAS admin script file you use to convert your application settings, include JDBC and JMS resources, from a WAS ND cell to a WAS Base container.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" src="../itc20/media/image23.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build the WAS Base server container image</p>
<p>a) Go back to the Terminal window and navigate to the <strong>/home/ibmdemo/cp4a-labs/lab2b</strong> directory with command</p>
<pre><code>cd /home/ibmdemo/cp4a-labs/lab2b
</code></pre>
<p>b) Execute the following command to build the WAS Base docker container image using the Dockerfile you just reviewed:</p>
<pre><code>docker build . -t default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.demo.ibmdte.net/demo/modresorts-twas:latest
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" src="../itc20/media/image24.png" /></p>
<p>This creates a WAS Base docker image called <strong>default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.demo.ibmdte.net/demo/modresorts-twas:latest</strong></p>
<p>Where:
- <strong>default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.demo.ibmdte.net</strong> is the OpenShift image registry Push URL
- <strong>demo</strong> is the OpenShift namespace
- <strong>*modresorts-twas:latest</strong> is the image name</p>
<p>c) After the docker container image is created, you can issue the command below to verify the docker image was created:</p>
<pre><code>docker images | grep twas
</code></pre>
<p>You see the docker image is created.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc20/media/image25.png" /></p>
<p>d) To verify the docker image and the application, create and run a local container called <strong>modresorts-twas</strong> with the command below:</p>
<pre><code>docker run --name modsorts-twas -p 9443:9443 -d default-route-openshift-image-registry.apps.demo.ibmdte.net/demo/ modresorts-twas:latest
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the container is created, you can test the <strong>Moderesorts</strong> application by launching it in a web browser window with the URL: <a href="https://localhost:9443/resorts"><strong>https://localhost:9443/resorts</strong></a></p>
<p>At this point, you have built the Docker container and tested the
ModResorts application in the local docker environment.</p>
<p>Next, you will push the Docker image to the OpenShift image registry and
deploy the application to the RedHat OpenShift cluster in the lab
environment.</p>
<p><br> </p>
<h2 id="push-the-was-container-image-to-openshift-image-registry"><strong>Push the WAS Container Image to OpenShift Image Registry</strong></h2>
<p>After the WAS container image is built, you need to push it to an image registry. In this lab, you are using the OpenShift Image Registry to host your WAS container image.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the Terminal window, issue the command below to login to the OpenShift cluster.</p>
<pre><code>oc login -u admin -p passw0rd
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new OpenShift project (namespace) called <strong>demo</strong> to host the image</p>

<p><br> </p>
<h2 id="deploy-the-was-container-to-openshift-cluster"><strong>Deploy the WAS Container to OpenShift Cluster</strong></h2>
<p>Now that the WAS container image is available in the OpenShift image registry, you will deploy the WAS container to the OpenShift cluster using the OpenShift “<strong>oc</strong>” CLI.</p>
<p>Kubernetes resource files (YAML) are needed to deploy the application to OpenShift (Kubernetes Cluster). Take a moment to review the deployment resources used in the lab.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>View the deployment YAML files. In this lab you are going to use three YAML files to deploy the WAS container, these files are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>deploy.yaml</strong> – create a WAS container in the OpenShift cluster</li>
<li><strong>service.yaml</strong> – create a service to expose the WAS container</li>
<li><strong>route.yaml</strong> – create a route to access the WAS container service</li>
</ul>
<p>a) From the <strong>File Manager</strong> window, navigate to <strong>/home/ibmdemo/cp4a-labs/lab2b/deploy</strong> directory where these three YAML files are located.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" src="../itc20/media/image36.png" /></p>
<p>b) Double-click the <strong>deploy.yaml</strong> file to open it in the text editor.</p>
<p>The file contains the basic requirements of the WAS container deployment. The container name is set as <strong>modresorts-app-twas</strong> and it is deployed to the <strong>demo</strong> namespace.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a social media post Description automatically generated" src="../itc20/media/image37.png" /></p>
<p>c) Double-click the <strong>service.yaml</strong> file to view its contents.</p>
<p>The file exposes the <strong>Modresorts</strong> application ports <strong>9080</strong> and <strong>9443</strong>. The port type in the OpenShift cluster is set as <strong>ClusterIP</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" src="../itc20/media/image38.png" /></p>
<p>d) Double-click the <strong>route.yaml</strong> file to view its contents.</p>
<p>The file defines the OpenShift route used for the WAS container as <strong>modresorts-app-twas.apps.demo.ibmdte.net</strong> which enables users to access the <strong>Modresorts</strong> application on a public address.</p>
<p><img alt="A screenshot of a cell phone Description automatically generated" src="../itc20/media/image39.png" /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deploy the WAS container to OpenShift cluster using the deployment YAML files that you reviewed.</p>
<p>a) From the Terminal window, change to the <strong>/home/ibmdemo/cp4a-labs/lab2b</strong> directory</p>
<pre><code>cd /home/ibmdemo/cp4a-labs/lab2b
</code></pre>
<p>b) Issue OpenShift CLI command to deploy the WAS container to the OpenShift cluster</p>
<pre><code>oc apply -f deploy
</code></pre>
<p><img alt="" src="../itc20/media/image40.png" /></p>
<p>The command deploys the resources defined in the three YAML files in the <strong>deploy</strong> directory and create WAS container pod, service, and route in the <strong>demo</strong> namespace.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p>Next, you will verify the deployment of the ModResorts application running in OpenShift</p>
<p><br> </p>
<h2 id="verify-the-deployment"><strong>Verify the Deployment</strong></h2>
<p>In this task, you access the OpenShift Web Console to verify the WAS container deployment</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Go back to the <strong>OpenShift Web Console</strong>, click <strong>Workloads >
    Pods</strong>, then select <strong>demo</strong> project from the project list, if it not already selected.</p>

<p><strong>Congratulations! You have successfully completed *App Modernization using WAS Base Container on OCP Lab!</strong>*</p>
<p><br> </p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this lab, you learned the App Modernization re-platform process to move an existing traditional WAS application to WAS Base container and to deploy it to an OpenShift cluster without any code change.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.ibm.com/components/cloud-pak-for-applications/">IBM Cloud Pak for Applications</a>, built on the Red Hat® OpenShift® Container Platform, provides a long-term solution to help you transition between public, private, and hybrid clouds, and to create new business applications.</p>
<p>As a key component of <strong>IBM Cloud Pak for Applications</strong>, traditional WebSphere application Server can still run in containers, and reap the benefits of consistency and reliability that containers provide.</p>
